# Software-Security


Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    Artemis Financial was trying to modernize their operations. They wanted the best security to protect their clients financial data. To do this they wanted to     add a file verification step in their web application.
  
What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
    I think I did well in adding comments to the code and adding input validation. It is important to code securely because without it data is unprotected. The     company would lose customers if they show to be untrustworthy. 
    
What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
    The hardest part for me was the actual coding part since I have little to no experience in cybersecurity or java.
    
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
    I added input validation within the code and added a hash function. In the future I would like to use the maven dependency check since it was very               beneficial in finding potential vulnerablities within my code.
    
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
    I did a lot of testing to make sure the code worked as intended and was secure. After refacotring I ran another maven dependency check to see if I               introduced any new vulnerabilities. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
    I mostly used the class resources or google to help me complete assignments. In the future I would like to learn more about Java so I can rely less on           external help. I found frequent testing while I was coding to figure out what each line does helped the most.
  
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
    I would probably show my has function since I thought it worked really well and functioned nicely.
